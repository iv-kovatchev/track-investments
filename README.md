# Track Investments

This is a web application for tracking investments on different users.
It is a portfolio application showing my knowledge of one of the most used 
Javascript frameworks. The application uses:

* React 18.2.51
* Typescript 4.9.5
* react-router-dom 6.22.0
* Sass 1.70.0
* Tanstack/React-Query 5.18.1

## Available commands

In the `client` directory, you can run:

### `npm start` or `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm install` or `yarn install`

It will install all libraries from `package.json`

### `npm run server` or `yarn server`

For now, the application is working with a local JSON server and if you
want to access any endpoint you need to start it on your machine.
